  "Armenia is a mountainous nation in West Asia, a former Soviet Republic, and was one of the first Christian nations, embracing Christianity in the fourth century. This rich cultural and natural environment makes it an exciting destination for a wide range of adventure, activity, and walking holidays. <br /> <br /> There are many pagan sites to visit as well as UNESCO World Heritage - listed churches, which are–almost without exception–built in stunning locations.Surrounded by forests, perched on the top of dramatic gorges or silhouetted before snow - capped mountains, they draw us to magnificent open spaces filled with a huge variety of trees and wild flowers.On Armenia tours we see wonderful mountains, lakes, and waterfalls in the countryside–and relish cooling breezes– while the cafés and restaurants of the country’ s capital, Yerevan, are proof of an emerging economy. Mount Ararat towers majestically over the city, and beautiful scenery is plentiful.";
